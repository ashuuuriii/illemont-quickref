### Training
- Teaching a pet a new trick or task requires a successful skill check. The type of skill check and the DC depends on how the PC is training their pet, the intelligence of the pet, and how friendly the pet currently is.
- Not everything can be tamed. There's always a risk your pet may try to attack you.
- Training doesn't apply to all party members. If party member A teaches a mimic to sit, party member B cannot command it to sit unless they've also trained it to sit. A different party member teaching the same pet the same trick makes the training roll with advantage.

### Combat Training
- PCs can give their pets combat training. Combat training doesn't train pets to perform specific actions instead just allows them to take turns and be commanded in combat.
- At least one successful combat training roll is required to command a pet in combat.
- Each successive successful combat training roll increases the likelihood the pet will follow the command by 10%.

n Training Rolls | Roll on d10 for pet to follow command
--- | --- 
1 | 6 or higher
2 | 5 or higher
3 | 4 or higher
4 | 3 or higher
5 | 2 or higher


### Combat
- Up to two pets may be used in combat.
- A pet can be commanded as a bonus action if it's within 60 feet of the PC. Only one command may be issued each round.
- They can be commanded to take any action that is available on their stat block, or to disengage and move.
- Pets do not get death saving throws unlike PCs.
- Pets have their own initiative. If no command is issued before the pet takes its turn or it refuses to follow commands, the DM decides what the pet does for that combat round.
- There is always a small chance the pet will refuse to follow commands. Roll 1d10 when issuing commands, the pet always refuses to listen on a roll of 1.
- The PC who commanded the pet makes rolls for the pet.
