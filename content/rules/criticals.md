Title: Critical Rolls
Date: 2023-06-17
Category: Table Rules

## Attack Rolls
Add max damage to the damage roll.
**Example:**
An attack that deals 2d8 damage will do 2d8 + 16 + modifiers damage on a critical.

## Saving Throws
RAW, criticals do not apply.

## Initiative
RAW, criticals do not apply.

## Ability and Skill Checks
RAW, critical rolls only apply to attack. But this will impact how successfully something succeeds or how badly something fails. For example, a rogue that succeeds a lock picking roll with a 1 will still open the lock but may break their lock pick in the process.

## Group Checks
A 20 counts as two successes and a 1 counts as 2 failures
