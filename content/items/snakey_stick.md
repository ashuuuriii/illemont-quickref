The snakes are friendly to you and your companions. On your turn as a bonus action you may issue simple commands to all the snakes. If you don't issue any commands, they will try to escape from Hostile creatures, but otherwise take no Actions. The DM has the snakes' Statistics.

Reverse: You can use this spell to transform snakes into sticks. Each snake beast in a 30' radius must make a Constitution save or be turned into a stick for the duration of the spell.
