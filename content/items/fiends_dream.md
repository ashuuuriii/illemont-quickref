#### Description
Usually available in tablet form, Fiend's Dream is covertly manufactured by underground alchemists looking to make extra gold on the side.

#### Effects
- Euphoria, a sense of happiness: advantage on saves against charm effects.
- Increased self-confidence and sociability: advantage on charisma-based skill checks.
- Mild hallucination
- Dilated pupils
- Altered sense of time and a sense of inner peace, -15 to movement speed
- DC13 con-save, on a failed save you gain disadvantage on stealth checks from teeth-grinding. You also suffer from paranoia and are frightened of a random creature within your line of sight (DM's discretion).
